Classes :
    Fraction

Functions:

    sum() : summation

    sub() : subtraction.

    mul() : multiply

    div() : divide() 

    f_to_n() : fraction_to_number

    simp() : simplification

    show()

How to use?

For each function you need  to create two objects ,except fraction_to_number and simplifiction.when you creat object first argument is  numenator and second one is denominaator.
For result you need to creat another object and in the end you should use show() funcion. For fraction to number or simplifiction you need to call them and then use show() like before

for example :

a=Fraction(4,5)
b=Fraction(7,9)
c=a.sum(b)
c.show()

c.simp()
c.show()
