# Tic Tac Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses) is a simple two-player game typically played on a 3x3 grid. Each player takes turns marking a square on the grid, one with "X" and the other with "O." The goal of the game is to be the first to align three of your marks either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
